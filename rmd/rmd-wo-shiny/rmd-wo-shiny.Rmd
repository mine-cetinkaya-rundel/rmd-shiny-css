**EVERYTHING WORKS AS EXPECTED.**

This is some regular text.

<div id="boxedtext">
This uses `div id="boxedtext"`.
It is expected to be ORANGE, and it works as expected.
</div>

<div id="section-boxedtext">
This uses `div id="section-boxedtext"`.
It is expected to be RED, and it works as expected.
</div>

This is an itemized list with blue background, and it works as expected:

1. Item 1
2. Item 2
