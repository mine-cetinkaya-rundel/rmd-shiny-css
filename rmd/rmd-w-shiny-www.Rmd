**CSS WORKS FOR ITEMIZED LIST, NOT FOR DIVS.**

This is some regular text.

And a Shiny app.

```{r echo=FALSE}
library(shiny)
shinyAppDir(system.file("examples/01_hello", package = "shiny"))
```

<div id="boxedtext">
This uses `div id="boxedtext"`.
It is expected to be ORANGE, and but it's RED, styled as `div id="section-boxedtext"`.
</div>

<div id="section-boxedtext">
This uses `div id="section-boxedtext"`.
It is expected to be RED, and it's not styled at all.
</div>

This is an itemized list with blue background, and it works as expected:

1. Item 1
2. Item 2
